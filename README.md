A repository documenting my hands-on studies and projects in the field of Machine Learning.

[Leia em Português (PT-BR)](README.PT-BR.md)

📚 About This Repository
This repository serves as a personal log of my journey into the world of Machine Learning. 

Here you will find a collection of projects, from foundational "Hello, World!" examples to more complex analyses, each contained in its own isolated environment.

📂 Repository Structure
This repository is structured as a monorepo for learning purposes, where each major project resides in its own directory with its own self-contained virtual environment and dependencies.

🛠️ How to Run a Project
Each project is self-contained. To run one, follow these steps:

Clone the repository:

git clone [https://github.com/SEU-USUARIO/SEU-REPO.git](https://github.com/SEU-USUARIO/SEU-REPO.git)
cd SEU-REPO

Navigate to the project's directory:

cd NOMEDOPROJETO

Create and activate the virtual environment:

python -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate

Install the specific dependencies for that project:

pip install -r requirements.txt

Run the main script:

python NOME_DO_SCRIPT.py
